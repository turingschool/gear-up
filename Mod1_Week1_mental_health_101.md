### Opening

As adults, we have all been in stressful situations before.  Most of us have not done an immersive program in a basement with no windows before.  We know that this type of enviornment can push you to your stress limits.  Even if you have managed stress well in the past, it is important to reflect on what has been working and what you might need to improve while you are here.

### Turn and Talk  (5 min)

When did you last feel stressed?

What happens to you when you are stressed?

### What is Stress? (2 min)

Webster Definition:
	
	A constraining force or influence: such as a force exerted when one body or body part presses on, pulls on, pushes against, or tends to compress or twist another body or body part…
	
	A physical, chemical, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and may be a factor in disease causation…

### Metaphors for Stress (2 min)

What happens when we stress ourselves? What kinds of metaphors are these:

* Our balloon has popped
* Tire popped
* Glass overflowed

These are not generally positive metaphors. 1 in 5 people annually experience a mental health crisis (49 million adults, 15 million children) NAMI; CDC. *It’s okay to have limits.* 

###  Types of stress (2 min)

* Eustress: moderate or normal psychological stress interpreted as being beneficial for the experiencer
* Distress: extreme anxiety, sorrow, or pain
* Acute Stress:  in response to a terrifying or traumatic event, or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong emotional response within the individual
* Eposodic Acute Stress: the stress which affects those who suffer from acute stress more frequently. People that tend suffer from this always seem to be in a rush. They take too much on and tend not to be able to organize themselves to deal with demands and pressures.
* Chronic Stress: response to emotional pressure suffered for a prolonged period of time in which an individual perceives they have little or no control. It involves an endocrine system response in which corticosteroids are released.
* Traumatic Stress: reactive anxiety and depression

Albrecht's Four Types
	Time Stress
	Anticipatory Stress
	Situational Stress
	Encounter stress

### Stress and the Triune Brain (3 min)

Stress starts in our lower spine and moves up our spinal cord:

* Hind Brain/Survival Brain: Flight, fight, or freeze instincts live here. For someone who develops PTSD, the reaction stems from a feeling that the initial stimulus is still present.
* Mid Brain/Emotional Brain: Where you are able to process emotion and can engage in your senses. If a negative emotion comes up, we might still revert to our survival brain.
* Frontal Cortex: This is our thinking brain, where we're able to plan and organize a response to stimuli. However, when we feel less safe, our blood can recede back to the hind brain.

If we don't manage our stress, we can't move into the mid brain or frontal cortext.
	
### Measuring Stress (2 min)

What happens to your body when you get stressed out?

Physiology

	Skin Conductivity
	Heart Rate
	Blood Pressure
	Cortisol levels
	
These inventories can help you understand your stress over time:

### Stress Management (6 min)
What is in your **locus of control**?

Quick Tips:

	Recognize stress for what it is.
	Listen to your body.
	Breathe.
	Implement resiliency mindsets.
	
Demo: What options do we have when we're under pressure?
* What freedom/strength can you draw from?
* Connect to hypo vs. hyper-arousal. What will this look like depending on the state you might be in at a given time? When do you feel stuck? If I brace against this force, am I able to move? 

Your brain influences your body on a constant feedback loop, and in return, your body is able to influence your brain too.
	
### Reflection (8 min)

* Fill out your window of tolerance worksheet for the past week 
* How did you feel when you came into this community? How do you feel at the end of week 1?
* What steps will you need to take to monitor your window of tolerance? 
* Do you have specific categories you need to focus on while at Turing?
* Optional: Try out the pressure exercise

### Pomodoro (5 mins)

* What are your stressors or triggers?
* What works for you?
* What can you create at Turing?

**Whole Group Share Out:** 
* What are some takeaways from the gallery walk?
* As a community, what can you be mindful of in regards to self-care that you can help each other with?

For larger cohorts: (5 mins)
* Go right to whole group debrief

### Reflection (6 min)
