# Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

“Nerd culture is now part of the zeitgeist. Come join us and learn why you got to get over your idea of what a nerd is, dude.” < dude is meant ironically.

Examples to keep in mind throughout discussion:

- Escapism, If I can’t be this way in real life then I will be this way in a game.
- GamerGate, ‘we have to gate ourselves from the feminist perspective.
- Game conventions - booth babes.
- Sexist achievement in games.
- Special suite of just putting the main female character in a thong.
- Fanservice for women?
- First person shooters, ‘Duke Nukem’ style main character.
- Some Anime styling ‘Moe’ pronounced (Moe ay)
