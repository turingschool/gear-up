## Ageism: A Lens for Exploring Diversity and Organizational Leadership (Facilitator Companion)

### Introductions (5 min)
* Assign timekeeper and note-taker.
* Share names and modules. 
* Establish groundrules: spend a few minutes talking about what a productive, respectful conversation will look like. Beyond the obvious, it may be helpful to highlight the importance of making space for people who are shy/soft-spoken, being careful not to interrupt others, making space for different opinions. 
* Facilitator to do a quick walkthrough of the agenda. 

### Scenario (5 min)
With your team, review the given scenario.  

### Strategize (35 min)
Consider these sub-categories as a way to structure your discussion. 

**Organizational Values**  
Before jumping into the discussion, it may be helpful to specifically define what values you share as a group.  
* Do you want to be able to cater to all customers?
* Do you want to be a company that supports employees' growth, including soft skills? What resources are you prepared to devote to this work?

**Define the Problem**  
Based on those values, discuss the problems you plan to tackle through your recommendations.  
* Is it merely that your employees are behaving inappropriately? 
* Are you comfortable walking away from the client?   
Unless you're clear on the problem, you may run into problems developing solutions as a group. 

**Recommendations**  
Develop solutions specifically targeted to address the problems you defined.
