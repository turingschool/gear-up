## Take Attendance
Depending on the cohort that you're in, Facilitator should pull up the attendance spreadsheet and quickly take attendance.

## Cohort Introduces Norms (Starting with 1810 cohort) 
The cohort introduces their norms from Mod 1 to the Facilitator. 

## Intro (2 min)

We are going to spend today practicing interrupting and apologizing for microaggressions and specifically practicing how we can build our skill at being able to interrupt microaggressions.  

## Norms (2 min)

We are going to add one additional norm to our class-established norms for this conversation:
	
	Take this seriously, no jokes about "microaggressions".


## Ice Breaker: Tangles and Knots (10 min)

There is no room today for the passive spectator. For this activity, we will stand in a circle. Remember who is on your left and your right. Instruct students to walk freely around the circle. The facilitator then calls out instructions - walk with those with the same colored hair as you, the same type of shoes, the same colored shirt. Then the facilitator will give more instructions - create three circles, or four triangles, or one star, and students must form those shapes. The facilitator will then instruct everyone to freeze, locate the person who stood to their right and their left, and point at them both, with the respective hand, without moving. Then slowly, begin to stretch and move toward their neighbors until the whole group is holding hands and tangled. Then the group must untie the knot while still holding hands until they are back in their original circle.

## Microaggression definition reminder (2 min)

A microaggression is a brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignity, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicates hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults towards marginalized groups.

## Interrupting Microaggressions reminder (2 min)

Challenges to interrupting microaggressions (in addition to the ones the group discusses):

	Lack of power or privilege
	
	Lack of relationship
	
	Caught off guard
	
	Unsure of intent 
	
	Don't realize it until it is too late
	
	Not in the right mindset to address the situation
	
	Can't find the right words to address the situation
	
	
	
It can be important to think about how to interrupt a microaggression from two different perspectives. As a TARGET and as an ALLY.  Oftentimes it will be easier to interrupt as an ALLY because you do not have the same risk as those who are the targets.  You might want to privately discuss the situation with the target before stepping in as an ally. The person committing the microaggression is called the AGENT. 


<b> Consider Context:  Should you address the person in the immediate group/situation or ask them to a 1:1 conversation? </b>
	
	Potential Script:
	
		I noticed you said X...
		
		Though it probably wasn't your intent, but that made me feel... 
			OR If I were a ______ that would might make me feel..
		
		Can you tell me more about why you said that?  
			OR In the future, you might want to consider the impact of that statement and instead say...
		
		* You might want to follow up with ____ because they seemed uncomfortable in that conversation
		
		*That made me feel X, and that's not ok with me. I'd like to continue focusing on our work right now though and talk to you about it later, would that work for you?


##  Accepting feedback (5 min)

We all commit microaggressions because it is part of how we are socialized, how we were brought up, how our country was formed.  As you become more aware, you will commit fewer microaggressions and be able to interrupt the cycle more consistently.  If you do get feedback that you committed a microaggression, remember:

	Accept it. 
	
	Applogize. (Even thank the person for helping you become more aware)
	
	Reflect on the situation.
	
	Learn from it.
	
	

## Role Play (10 min)

Form groups of 3 or 4.  For each role play, allow the ally to interrupt the microaggression first.  Then role play again and allow the target to interrupt the microaggression.  Reflect on the process once you have both responded. 


<b> Scenario 1  </b>
Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A (woman):  I have a really great idea about this problem.  I think we should use the spread operator

Person B:  *Interrupts person A before she finishes* I think we should go a different direction. 

Person A:  Well, I think if we used the spread operator...

Person B: *Interrupts again* I am pretty sure that we should try to use a different method.  


<b> Scenario 2  </b>

Target of microaggression:  A person of color

Person A (Person of color):  I am really nervous about this job search. 

Person B:  Why are you nervous?  You are going to do just fine because companies love diversity.  


<b> Scenario 3  </b>

Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A:  Let's get started with this meeting.  (Turns to the only woman in the group)  Can you take notes?  I'm so bad at taking notes.  


<b> Scenario 4  </b>

Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A (woman):  I am really looking forward to learning more about blockchain. 

Person B:  That is a really complex topic.  Are you sure you want to jump into that?

<b> Scenario 5  </b>

Target of microaggression:  Someone who identifies as LGBT

Person A:  What did you do this weekend?

Person B (target):  My partner and I went out to this awesome new restaurant. 

Person A:  Oh!  I didn't know you had a partner.  You know, you should meet my good friend who is also gay. You would love them! 

<b> Scenario 6  </b>

Target of microaggression:  Someone who identifies as LGBT

Person A: I love your sweatshirt!

Person B:  Thanks, it is my partner's shirt.

Person A: I wish I was gay so that I could share a wardrobe.  That must be so nice!

<b> Scenario 7  </b>  

Target of microaggression: A person of color

Person A:  Have you noticed that all of our speakers this inning have been white men?

Person B:  You are always so sensitive about race.  There probably aren't any developers of color who were able to come in.  

<b> Scenario 8  </b>

Target of microaggression: A woman

Person A:  We should get ready to present.  Who wants to do what part?


Person B: (To the woman in the group) Well, you should go up there to be our eye candy for the presentation.

## Theatre of the Oppressed Fishbowl (30 min)

Have one group of 3 students go to the middle of the room. Form a circle/ fishbowl around the center group. The center group will act out a scenario of their choice in full. Everyone around the circle is a Spect-actor (no spectators). Once the first scenario has been acted out, spect-actors will raise their hand in a Stop gesture if they're ready to jump in. They then name who they'd like to replace in the scenario. If anyone else in the audience would like to replace another actor, they may be replaced at this time as well.

Each scenario should be acted out in full no more than 3 times before switching to a new scenario with the actors in the center. They may use the list provided or create their own scenario based on a real-life situation. 

## Closing/Debrief (5 min)

Share in small groups or in whole group

Discussion: 
* What are the lenses that you need to become more aware of in order to interrupt microaggressions? 
* What did it feel like to be in the different roles?
* What did it feel like to be observing?
* How can we tie this experience back to the idea of generative hope?
* How does this experience help you honor and appreciate lived experiences and identities of those in the room and at Turing at large?

### Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
