* In what settings do you think this style is most effective? Reflect on a specific occasion when this style helped you be effective (build relationships, advance a cause you cared about, sell an idea).
* Reflect on the other three communication styles? How would you characterize your reactions to people with these other styles? Does your reaction change depending on the context (a casual outing with friends versus a high-pressure project with colleagues?
