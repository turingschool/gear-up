# Struggle

## Opening (4 minutes)

“**If there is no struggle, there is no progress.** Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. *They want rain without thunder and lightning.* They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.” - [Frederick Douglass](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6398-if-there-is-no-struggle-there-is-no-progress-those

What do you struggle with?

Most of us are here at Turing to change direction. Does that mean we're "correcting course"? Not necessarily. The challenges that led up to this were formative and worthwhile. Doing something new doesn't necessarily devalue the things we've done before.

But, as humans, we struggle. We each have struggles. They might be...

* Physical
* Intellectual
* Emotional

Today let's think about struggle, name our struggles, and attempt to exert control over them.

## Writing (20 minutes)

Spend the first chunk of time thinking and writing:

* What's your greatest physical struggle?
* What's your greatest intellectual struggle?
* What's your greatest emotional struggle?

Then...

* How do each of those struggles affect you on a daily basis?
* How do you try to combat these struggles? Are these efforts effective?

Then look at the three and pick the one that has the most profound/widespread/negative affect on you. We'll call this your *essential struggle*:

* What situations or factors amplify the struggle?
* Is it a struggle that others can see?
* How do other people affect your understanding or awareness of it?
* How do other people affect your ability to battle it?
* What would it look like to *lose* to this struggle?
* What would it look like to *win*?

## Discussing (20 Minutes)

Get together in your small groups and...

* Find whether you have any common struggles among the three types
* Which of the struggles named in your group are likely common to the larger
student body? Why?
* Which of the struggles named in your group are likely unique/uncommon to the larger student body? Why?
* Share, as you're willing, about your *essential struggle*. How has it affected your life to this point? How will it influence your future?
* What strategies do you use to combat your struggles? Are any of your group's strategies similar despite the struggle being different?
* How do you mesh your strategies with the demanding, rigid environment of Turing?
* Does being here help attack your struggle, or does it make it worse?
* If help, can Turing or our community change to do even better?
* If hurt, can Turing or our community change to not make it worse?

Your group will get a stack of sticky notes. If you're willing, please *each* use *two* stickies:

* On the first one, describe your struggle in a few words (leave it anonymous)
* On the second one, describe your most successful strategy for combating it

Then stick the strategy on to the struggle and, as we wrap, put your struggle/strategy combo on the whiteboard.
