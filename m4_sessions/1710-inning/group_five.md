Group Five

Session Title: "Learning another language"

Description: Why should students come to this session? 
* Students will need to be comfortable learning another language by the time they leave Turing if they want to market themselves as more than just Rails- or JavaScript- developers.

Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session?
* Students will be better able to start thinking about other languages they may want to learn after Turing (or for their capstones). They will leave with some resources for tutorials, etc. if they want to delve more into a particular language.

Session Outline:  Include the flow of the session and the time for each section.

- Preface with the fact that many of us will not be working in one language for all of our careers. The ability to learn another language is paramount to demonstrating marketable skills.
