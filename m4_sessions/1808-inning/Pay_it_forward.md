## Introductons 
Each leader will stand in a corner of the room 
Intros- Name and mod and experience with 1 of our 4 activities 
We'll sort them on the board so they get organized into groups that are not related to the task we are teaching.

## Intro to new material
Read the Article
Each leader from their corner
Each person will give brief story or connection of paying it forward in tech.

Adam - leaning towards example
Jude - Speak about paying it forward and the pivitol role it plays tech

## Small Group Activity
Get 4 volunteer teachers 
Separate into groups, explain what they are going to make a first unlead attempt at while we teach the volunteers the task. 
Then the volunteers will cascade style teach each group member, along with the previous student. 

## Closing Discussion
Leaders to 4 corners 
Throw rubber duck around so each person reflects on what they learned or any aha moments. 

Tie it together.
