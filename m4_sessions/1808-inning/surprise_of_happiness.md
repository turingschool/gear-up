## Recommended Trajectory 

     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
    
## Introductons

     --write these on the board

## Intro to new material

## Small Group Activity

     Have people line up by if they are a cat person, dog person, or both and then dance partner them so cat people are      working with dog people. 

## Closing Discussion

     Talk about what actually makes you happy and what are you going to do moving forward during your Turing career that will make you happy.
