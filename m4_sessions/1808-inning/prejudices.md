## Name of Session: 

## Session Description 

Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. In this session we will identify, examine, and discuss our prejudices, biases, and our related experiences with the aim of creating concrete actionable solution to make tech and our broader communities more (inclusive**?)

## Session Outcomes 

(What will students learn/leave with?): 

## Session Outline 
* Intros (10-15 mins) led by entire group. Includes rules for how conversations will elvolve to make a safe space for discussion
* Implicit Bias Tests (10 mins) Students should bring a computer and we will slack them the link for implicit bias tests with instructions to take a test on a topic that they either know very little about or something they feel very 'woke' to.  We haven't decided which way to lean. If you're not sure of what tests to take, take a test for a group that you identify with.
* Small Group Discussion (15 mins) Break into 3 small groups, each facilitated by a group member to discuss results, reactions to results, etc
* Recap (5 min) Led by Dream Team. Debrief from small group conversations by sharing relevant points from each group. 
* Regroup (20 mins) led by all 3 group members.  Discuss how this related to tech.  Start with broad example like racist twitterbot and then bring it down to a more personal level with examples from Turing.  Ask what are steps to take when things like this happen in your community.  Discuss potential actions. 
## Recommended Trajectory 
## Norms
* Listen
* Take people's stories at face value - no questioning authenticity/experience
* Check reactions when listening - don't make the story about you when it's someone else's story
* Frame when/how to use words that may be offensive - leaders give personal example
* Suggest parking lot for later discussions
## Questions for Small Groups
* what tests did you take?
* did your results surprise you?
* Do you have internalized prejudice? (If you took a test that you share a diversty marker with)
* When have you been a target of prejudice?  Alternately, when have you been complicit (through action or inaction)?

## Larger Group Takeaways
* If someone confronts you about a particular situation where they felt marginalized and you contributed to this feeling, don't make them process your feelings about the situation.  It's not their job to comfort you, it's your job to listen, and take feedback.
* Turing is not immune to biases and prejudice.  It happens here. 
* If you have identified a prejudice you hold, what can you actively do to counteract or stop it? (short term counteracted by being exposed to alternatives to their particular prejudice - seek out things that challenge your particular bias)
