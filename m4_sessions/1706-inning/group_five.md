# Group Five

# Session Title: How & When to Learn a New Programming Language

### Group members: Devon Bull, Jenn Peavler, Victoria Vasys, Joseph Glass, Chris Jordan

## Blurb
* No one wants to be a one-language-trick-pony! How do you become a bilingual pony? We've gotchya covered.
    
## Prework
* Consider which language you'd like to learn next!
* Add your github name to the channel!
* [Repo](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language) that the students will be added to

## Session Outcomes:
- Create a repo of resources and tutorials for learning new languages and technologies that students can contribute to.
- Provide outline of our process and experiences
- Provide space for people to share their own challenges and solutions.

## Session Outline

### 1. Whole Group Discussion

##### 10 min Intros
  * What's your name, cohort, where are you from?
What is the next language you'd like to learn?

##### 15 min Background


##### Deliberate Practice (Joseph - 3 min)
  - Process of learning
    - ID a specific subset
    - Focus on performance in that subset
    - Get feedback
    - Update

   - Motivations & Accountability
    - Project
    - Teaching
      - Tutoring
      - Blog posts
      - Pairing

   - Pitfalls
     - Don't read book cover to cover without coding along the way.

##### When to start / resources (Victoria - 2 min)
  - Career Impact, Motivations, Depth vs. breadth
  - Docs (Environment Setup)
  - Books
  - Hello World
  - Stack Overflow
  - Practice!
    * [exercisms](http://exercism.io/languages/)
    * [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
    * [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
    * [Turing challenges](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges)
  - Find Online communities
    * [reddit](reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)

##### Video (Jenn - 5 mins)
  * [Learn a language fast](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/06/15/learn-new-programming-language-fast/)

##### What learning actually looks like (Devon - 3 min):
  - Picked a technology: Mongodb
  - 1st Went to CodeSchool and watched Videos
  - Went to Mongo Docs and Created a Database on Cloud
  - Connected to Database from my system
  - Experiments: Add a record
  - Delete the table
  - Run into problem, check with Stack Overflow
  - Back to Docs: Not good, Back to CodeSchool
  - Continue through trial and err


### 2. 30 min Small Group Discussion
- Vote on languages we'd like to learn.
- Break into 5 groups.
- Walk through those steps

 ###### Questions At Start (5 mins)
 * Why'd you pick this language?
 * What have you tried before, failures and successes?

 ###### Brief walkthrough of the starting techniques  we've discussed by the facilitator. (5 mins)

 ###### Questions to Consider (10 mins)
 * What are the differences between this language and my native language?
    * Ex. Ruby vs JS equality
 * How can I get fast feedback on what works?
    * Editors IRB, Node,
 * What companies are using this language.
 * Make Hello World in Repl.com or another online editor
 * Other Findings

 ###### Share findings with small group
 * decide on points to share
 ###### Share two of your findings on the whiteboard (5 mins)
 * Submit the resources and challenges you found on the repo!

### 3. 15 min Wrap Up
- Each group expands on their bullet points
- Share the repo
