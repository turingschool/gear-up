## Group Three's Session Plan

M4 Student Leaders: Lauren, Amy, Dan, Jason, Chelle


# Session 1   3/17/17

### ADDITIONAL TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION THAT WERE GLOSSED OVER:

The automation gear up seemed to be presented i a gloomy-doomy light--maybe could lighten the tone with more dissection
of the topic. (See the second GENERAL SESSION OUTLINE)

Just because you CAN doesn't necessarily mean you SHOULD.--needs addressing in order for us, as techies, to be empathetic and 
aware of what's happening.

What is it going to do to the quality of life of not the two ends of the financial spectrum, but the middle-class?

Environmental impact of making and maintaining robots?

### GENERAL SESSION OUTLINE REFORMATS:

Would have like more time to mull it over solo and writing time.

Sending out the reading a day in advance.  Helps facilitate discussion.

Need to find an article that is a polar opposite view on the material presented in the original gear up.


# Session 2    3/31/17

### Intro 5 min
Consider creating a 'spectrum of opinion' as to where one stands on the issue being discussed  (similar to when we lined up on the wall during the original AI gear up)   3-5 minutes
#### ask for 'why'
substantiate your initial opinion
### movie time! omg 25 min

### round table discussion 30 minutes for discussion

### Give the option of reading the material in advanced and allowing/requiring students to gather the media that supports their point of view to be read/watched during the actual gear up.  The students are in control of their own fun. The students can discuss the assigned articles or are welcome to present another source of information that supports their point of view 

### Alternatively, consider a 'round-table' discussion that includes everyone vs. divving up a group



### Leave plenty of time for discussion & writing. 20-30 minutes
