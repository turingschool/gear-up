## Mission Alignment

Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.

As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually.
Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward
solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs
they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.
