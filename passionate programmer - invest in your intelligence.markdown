# Invest In Your Intelligence

## Structure

Please break up into your assigned groups and:

* Spend the first 6 minutes reading the article
* Spend 10 minutes writing notes in response to the questions
* Spend 15 minutes discussing your answers with your group
* Spend 10 minutes on a Mission Statement
* Get back together for a quick full-group discussion

## Reading - 6 Minutes

Read the "Invest in Your Intelligence" segment.

## Personal Writing - 10 Minutes

1. Consider your intentions here at Turing. What was your plan for your
own learning coming into the program? Have you executed that plan? When you've gotten off plan or off track, how have you corrected yourself?
2. Consider strength in your cohort. Who sets the highest standard for learning? What makes you say that? Remember that hours invested are not equal to learning won. Do other people get swept into their halo? Do they affect you positively? Have you ever told them?
3. Consider weakness in your cohort. Who undercuts your motivation/focus/ability to learn? How does that happen? How can you build a plan that resilient in the face of these challenges?
4. Consider your long-run trajectory. If you graduate Turing with exactly what we've asked you to do then you've met the minimum bar of achievement. To a company you're the least interesting person available. It won't feel good to know you've let opportunity pass you by. What responsibility do you take and what goals will you achieve during your remaining time here to be remarkable in one or more ways?

## Group Discussion - 15 Minutes

The most interesting and provocative discussions come from weakness, not strength. Resist the urge to devolve into "here's why I'm awesome" and instead try to find ways to fill each other's gaps and turn doubt into hope.

1. Discuss your individual progress. What have you done better than you expected here at Turing? What have you struggled with most? What's one or two things that you've *intended* to do but haven't? Why haven't you? Don't let each other off with the excuse of "not enough time," there's always a reason deeper than that.
2. Discuss your cohort. How has the energy, character, and vibe of your cohort changed over time? What's stronger/better and what's weaker/worse? What do you observe about your cohort in comparison to others? What attributes/characteristics do you wish you could change about your cohort? What's stopping you?
3. Discuss the staff and our classes/assignments. Who/what pushes you to do your best work? What demotivates you or slows your progress? Are you doing just what you're asked to do, or are you pushing further? What experiences have led to your biggest milestones of learning?
4.

## Mission Statement - 10 Minutes

We've talked about your "why?" in the past. You've thought about your intentions coming into the program, discussed what's happened while you've been here, and now it's time to make a plan.

What is your *mission* here? What is the benchmark against which you can make all your decisions between now and graduation? Write at least five versions of a mission statement. Try to avoid platitudes. Get specific. Write a statement that, the day after you graduate, you'll be able to critically evaluate whether or not you succeeded.

## Full Group - 10 Minutes

Finally let's get back together and discuss.
