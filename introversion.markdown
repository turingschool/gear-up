# Introversion and Extroversion on Teams
After synthesizing feedback from our last Gear Up, we are going to provide more discussion and less reading time this week.  We also are going to spend time discussing in cohorts so that we can apply our learning to working within our current teams and cohorts.  

## Watch (20 min)
Watch this TED talk by Susan Cain, author of [_Quiet: The Power of Introverts_] (https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts?language=en). If you'd like to watch it alone with headphones, feel free to relocate to another classroom to do so. 

## SKIM (5 min)
SKIM this _Harvard Business Review_ article, ["Introverts, Extroverts, and the Complexities of Team Dynamics."](https://hbr.org/2015/03/introverts-extroverts-and-the-complexities-of-team-dynamics) (Francesca Gino: March 16, 2015).

## Reflect (8 min)
Cain and Gino both suggest that the world is designed in a way that favors extroverts. In spite of our field being more inviting to introverts than others, we still practice many habits around meeting, project, and professional development protocols that favor extroverted over introverted style. 

You already have opportunities to make your projects and Turing activities more hospitable to introverted personalities. Use the following questions to investigate these opportunities more deeply and identify strategies for reshaping them. Write your answers in your notebook or in a [new gist](https://gist.github.com/).  

1. Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What were the benefits and challenges of the styles?
2. How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of introverts?  How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of extroverts?
3. How can you leverage the strengths of introverts and extroverts in your future projects and future career?
4. Do you think our current approaches to group activities at Turing are sufficiently accommodating to introverted personalities? Reflect on how we could reshape team and group activities (pairings, team retros, cohort retros) to create an environment in which introverts’ and extroverts strengths are equally supported.  

## Discuss (20 min)
Find a group of 4 from your cohort. Groups should be no larger than 4.  

Make sure to assign someone in your group the role of timekeeper, facilitator, and listening monitor to remind everyone to practice active listening. Take collective responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

Spend the first 10 minutes having each person share ONE response or reflection from questions 1-3.  Take the last 10 minutes discussing question 4 and determine 1-2 key changes that we could make within our cohorts or organization.
