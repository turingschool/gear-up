## Intro (8 min)

We are going to spend today discussing microagressions and specifically discussing how we can build our skill at being able to interrupt microaggressions.  We began discussing this in Mod 1 when we watched Code: Debugging the Gender Gap.  In that movie, we heard the phrase from Megan Smith, "Death by 1,000 cuts."  At Turing, we see microagressions happen daily.  Today we will look at a set of scenarios that have happened on our campus with our well intentioned students and staff that care about inclusion.  We all commit microagressions, yet we have never been taught the skills of how to discuss or interrupt them.



## Norms (5 min)

We are going to agree to a set of norms for this conversation so that we can get uncomfortable and learn together in this space.  
	
	
	Believe other people's experience
	
	Confidential conversations
	
	Speak from your own experience
	
	Ask questions instead of assuming


## Small Group Discussion (8 min)


1) When did you first learn about differences between race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation?

2) What was your experience like in talking about these differences?

3) How did that experience impact your ability to talk about those differences now?

Key Points:

    * In our society, white people often were taught not to talk about race or to be color blind, where as people of color have to talk about race on a daily basis.
    
    * How our parents or family talk about difference impacts how we talk about difference.
    
    * No where in our education system do we help all people build skill to navigate difference.  It's pretty hard to be good at something that you never practice.  Therefore we continually avoid the things we are not good at, which only makes it harder to discuss.
    


## Microaggression (5 min)

A microagression is a brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults towards marginalized groups.

Pair Share: 

* What do you notice about this definition?

* Why are these harmful?  


## Every Day Microagressions (4 min)

Here are a few comments that would considered microagressions.  

* "Diversity is important, but we won't lower the bar."

* "You will for sure get hired.  Companies love diversity."

* "What do you mean you aren't a Broncos fan?  What kind of man are you?"

What is harmful about these statements?  


*Generally speaking, when identifying microaggressions Sue considers it best to believe the one who perceives the bias. “Almost all of the studies indicate that the people who are most disempowered have the most accurate perception of a situation of bias because people who have power don’t need to understand the situation in order to do well,” he says.

## Where do microagressions come from? (3 min)

| Structural/Laws        | Social          
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 3/5ths rule      | family | 
| voting rights     | media      |  
| red lining | friends      |   
| Marriage rights      | stereotypes | 
| Immigration   | biases      |  


<i> Historically, we have a the United States was created with laws that systematically oppressed certain groups of people.  Though we might not all have grown up here, we ALL are a part of today's society that has been formed from that history.  We ALL have a part to change things that we do not feel are providing an equal opportunity for everyone.  If we do not interupt this cycle, we are more likely to stay in segregated communities or social circles that continue to deepen the biases that we have developed.  </i>

We also know that there are different types of experiences that will increase our dependence on bias and stereotypes.

* Does this sound like Turing? *

## Interruping Microagressions (5 min)

Pair Share: 

* What is challenging about interrupting microagressions? 

Challenges to interrupting microagressions (in addition to the ones the group discusses):

	Lack of power or privilege
	
	Lack of relationship
	
	Caught off guard
	
	Unsure of intent 
	
	Don't realize it until it is too late
	
	Not in the right mindset to address the situation
	
	Can't find the right words to address the situation
	
	
	
It can be important to think about how to interrupt a microagression from two different perspectives. As a TARGET and as an ALLY.  Often times it will be easier to interrupt as an ALLY because you do not have the same risk as those who are the targets.  You might want to privately discuss the sitaution with the target before stepping in as an ally.


<b> Consider Context:  Should you address the person in the immediate group/situation or ask them to a 1:1 conversation? </b>
	
	Potential Script:
	
		I noticed you said X...
		
		Though it probably wasn't your impact, that made me feel... 
			OR If I were a ______ that would might make me feel..
		
		Can you tell me more about why you said that?  
			OR In the future, you might want to consider the impact of that statement and instead say...
		
		* You might want to follow up with ____ because they seemed uncomfortable in that conversation
		
		*That made me feel X, and that's not ok with me. I'd like to continue focusing on our work right now though and talk to you about it later, would that work for you?


##  Accepting feedback (2 min)

We all commit microagressions because it is part of how we are socialized, how we were brought up, how our country was formed.  As you become more aware, you will commit less microagressions and be able to interrupt the cycle more consistently.  If you do get feedback that you committed a microagression, remember:

	Accept it. 
	
	Applogize. (Even thank the person for helping you become more aware)
	
	Reflect on the situation.
	
	Learn from it.
	
	

## Role Play (10 min)

Form groups of 3 or 4.  For each role play, allow the ally to interrupt the microagression first.  Then role play again and allow the target to interrupt the microagression.  Reflect on the process once you have both responded. 


<b> Scenario 1  </b>
Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A (woman):  I have a really great idea about this problem.  I think we should use the spread operator

Person B:  *Interrupts person A before she finishes* I think we should go a different direction. 

Person A:  Well, I think if we used the spread operator...

Person B: *Interrupts again* I am pretty sure that we should try to use a different method.  


<b> Scenario 2  </b>````

Target of microaggression:  A person of color

Person A (Person of color):  I am really nervous about this job search. 

Person B:  Why are you nervous?  You are going to do just fine because companies love diversity.  


<b> Scenario 3  </b>

Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A:  Let's get started with this meeting.  (Turns to the only woman in the group)  Can you take notes?  I'm so bad at taking notes.  


<b> Scenario 4  </b>

Target of microaggression:  A woman

Person A (woman):  I am really looking forward to learning more about blockchain. 

Person B:  That is a really complex topic.  Are you sure you want to jump into that?

<b> Scenario 5  </b>

Target of microaggression:  Someone who identifies as LGBT

Person A:  What did you do this weekend?

Person B (target):  My partner and I went out to this awesome new restaurant. 

Person A:  Oh!  I didn't know you had a partner.  You know, you should meet my good friend who is also gay. You would love them! 

<b> Scenario 6  </b>

Target of microaggression:  Someone who identifies as LGBT

Person A: I love your sweatshirt!

Person B:  Thanks, it is my partner's shirt.

Person A: I wish I was gay so that I could share a wardrobe.  That must be so nice!

<b> Scenario 7  </b>  

Target of microagression: A person of color

Person A:  Have you noticed that all of our speakers this inning have been white men?

Person B:  You are always so sensitive about race.  There probably aren't any developers of color who were able to come in.  

<b> Scenario 8  </b>

Target of microagression: A woman

Person A:  We should get ready to present.  Who wants to do what part?


Person B: (To the woman in the group) Well, you should go up there to be our eye candy for the presentation.
