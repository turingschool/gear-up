Grouping: please put your cohorts into small groups of 3-4 students before the film



##Intro: (5 min)


* At Turing, our mission is to train a diverse, inclusive student body for high fulfillment careers.  In order to do that, we need to understand the experiences of people who are different from us. 
* We know that tech is not an inclusive place for everyone.  We want to bring this conversation to the forefront of your experiences together so that your cohort can start to build a more inclusive expeirence.
* We are going to watch some clips from Code: Debugging the Gender Gap.  It is on Netflix and we recommend that you watch the full movie at some point.  After each clip, we will have sometime for discussion.
* The movie specifically addresses the experience of people who do not identify as men.  It also conveys gender as either man or woman, instead of the spectrum that gender really is.  Don't discount everything in the film because of that, but also keep it in mind.
*One other thing to consider is that you will hear, "all men" or "all women" at multiple times in this movie.  We know that using the word ALL is over generalizing.  Again, do not discount this perspective, but keep in mind that it is not a good practice to generalize for any group of people.

##Norms:

* Accept everyone's story as truth
* Ask instead of assume
* Be mindful of your position and power

### Option to show all clips at once.  If so, please write the following questions on the board before starting the clips:


1) How did (or didn't) your education prepare you to become a software developer?

2) How does diversity impact software development?

2) What are the stories we tell about who belongs in the industry?  Or even here at Turing?

3) How could you create a more inclusive and welcoming place for people who are different from you?  



##Part 1

Clip: 7:45-13:25  (6 min)

Discussion: (8 min)

1) Did you know the history of women in computer programming?

2) What suprised you about the current gender breakdown in tech?


##Part 2
Clip:15:26-32:25 (8 min)

Discussion (10 min)

1) How did (or didn't) your education prepare you to become a software developer?

2) How does diversity impact software development?

##Part 3
Clip: 41:28-52:30 (10 min)

Discussion (15 min)

1) These stories are real.  What other stories or experience have pushed you toward or away from a career as a software developer?

2) What are the stories we tell about who belongs in the industry?  Or even here at Turing?

3) How could you create a more inclusive and welcoming place for people who are different from you?  

##Closing

As you leave here today, we hope that this conversation continues in your cohort and that you are able to use this common language to address issues of inclusion as they might come up.  What will you do to create a better experience that is inclusive of everyone while you are here (where it is easy) and when you go out into the workforce?
