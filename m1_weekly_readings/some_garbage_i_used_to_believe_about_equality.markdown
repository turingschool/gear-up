## Some Garbage I Used to Believe About Equality

Read Johnathan Nightingale's ["Some Garbage I Used to Believe About Equality"](https://mfbt.ca/some-garbage-i-used-to-believe-about-equality-e7c771784f26#.ryozbcopw) and reflect on the following questions.

* What steps does Nightingale suggest someone take to educate themselves about inequality? Have you encountered this idea before? Does Nightingale’s suggestion feel radical to you? Why? Why does he suggest going to the lengths he does?
* Nightingale describes the temptation to “want to be able to have an intellectual conversation about [social issues and people’s experiences].” What damage can intellectual conversation at the wrong time have? When is the right time for intellectual conversation?
* Nightingale identifies as a white male and targets his message particularly at others of that group. If you’re a white male, what parts of Nightingale’s perspective do you find especially challenging? If you’re not a white male, what would your version of Nightgale’s post look like for the communities you identify with? What would your message of social responsibility look like?
