# Automation and The Future

## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually. Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.


## Warm Up (5 min)

Before we begin watching this session's videos, we will do a quick exercise to identify students attitudes on automation and its implications for our future. On the left end, people who feel strongly that automation is, as Elon Musk says, "summoning a demon." On the right, people who feel automation is going to take humanity to new, positive, exciting potential. Line up in between these poles as appropriate.


## Watch (25 min)

To kick off today's session, we are going to watch these two videos that include some alarming information about the effects automation will have on our economy in the near future:

*   ["Humans Need Not Apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) (CGP Grey: Aug 13, 2014)
*   ["Do labor-saving robots spell doom for American workers?"](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/labor-saving-robots-spell-doom-american-workers/) (PBS: July 30, 2015)

As you watch these videos, reflect and take notes on the following questions:

*   How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire?
*   Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes?
*   What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue?
*   What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?

## Discuss (25 min)
In groups of 3-4, discuss your answers to the questions above.
