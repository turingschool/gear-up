# Privilege and Empathy

## Background

Privilege refers to the advantages that individuals and groups are afforded in systems of power (communities, organizations, countries, families, etc.). Often, conversations about privilege become ones where stark lines are drawn between "haves" and "have-nots"; we're aiming for a slightly different discussion today, where we'll focus on how privilege and marginalization affect our relationships with each other how we can navigate these dynamics to work better together.


## Session Overview

Here's what we're going to do today:

#### 1. Review a list of statements that describe the different ways people in our society may experience privilege or marginalization.

Everyone will interact with these statements differently because we all walk in the door today with different experiences. That diversity of experiences is a strength of our community.

##### Why

These statements help illustrate how varied our experiences of privilege/marginalization are, and will help every individual in the session connect with both sides of the power dynamic.


#### 2. Write/reflect on how, as an individual, your unique experiences of privilege and marginalization have affected your sense of connection to those around us.

Inevitably, everyone will have some experiences that roughly fit in the category of being marginalized, and everyone will have some experiences that roughly fit in the category of being privileged. One thing that these experiences share is they both seem to have a pretty profound effect on people's feeling of connection to those around them. We will set aside a period of time to write and reflect on both types of experiences.

##### Why

Today's discussion will rely on taking the academic topic of privilege and relating it to our day-to-day lives. While the first exercise helps people connect personally to the topic, writing provides everyone some space to more fully process the effect of those experiences on our relationships with each other.


#### 3. Meet in groups to discuss what came up during our writing

We'll organize in groups of 4-5 to review the material we wrote on and work together to explore the topic with one another.

##### Why

Sharing and listening are both an important part of processing this material. We learn by figuring out how to articulate complicated experiences respectfully; by listening, we have a chance to learn from others and appreciate how our experiences connect us.


#### 4. Discuss how these dynamics affected our ability to work together last inning.

We'll continue discussion in the same groups, but pivot to some new questions focused specifically on ways in which privilege and marginalization shape our experience at Turing.

##### Why

Today's exercise is intended to help all the individuals in your class develop awareness and empathy around privilege so that you can make meaningfully changes to how you interact in your remaining 5 months together. Pivoting the discussion towards real life, right now, helps us continue to direct this conversation from something cerebral to something that makes a difference in people's lives today.


#### 5. We'll wrap with some private reflection.

We'll take a few minutes to tie all this back to what we can each do, as individuals, to stay connected.

##### Why

Ultimately, today's conversation should lead to individuals' ability to connect with others in spite of experiencing privilege differently in the dynamics they share. Individuals need time to tie this really complex topic back to what can they do, today, to connect and do right by others who are affected by privilege and marginalization.


## Setup

Chairs and tables available for small group discussions. Students start out seated in their groups.


## Introductions (10 min)

The facilitator will kick of the session by reviewing the overview described above. After that overview, small groups will do whip around to each member: every individual should share briefly how they're feeling (concerns about the session, lunch coma, TGIF).

## Discuss (30 min)

We'll meet in groups to discuss what came up during our writing. Please be attentive to being respectful, active listeners.

When there are about 10 minutes left, the facilitator will announce the final prompt: _Communication style, gender norms, introversion/extroversion, learning styles are all areas in which individuals at Turing experience privilege and marginalization. As a group, identify 4-5 scenarios in which you've observed students in your class experiencing similar types of disparities. How well do you think you've done as individuals and as a group to mitigate these disparities when possible or stay connected when they occur?_

## Final Reflection (5 min)

We'll take a few minutes to tie this really complex topic back to what we, as individuals, can do today to connect and do right by others who are affected by the disparities we discussed in groups. Remember, privilege is not a concept we're using to make individuals feel guilty, rather it is a framework in which we can better understand each other and stay connected in spite of widely varying experiences.
