## Gear Up - The Gender Gap in Technology

### Reflection (15 minutes)

Write a response to the following questions. This reflection is for you and no one else will be reading it.

* In your opinion, why are there so few women in technology?
* How have you experienced the underrepresentation of women in technology?

### Code: Debugging The Gender Gap (90 minutes)

We'll watch a documentary called _Code: Debugging the Gender Gap_ in the Big Workspace. You can find the trailer [here](http://www.codedoc.co/about/).

### Break (10 minutes)

### Introduction to Debrief Session (5 minutes)

In order to debrief the movie, we're going to break into small groups. You'll have the choice to join whatever group you feel most connected to at the moment. During our small group discussion, we want everyone to keep in mind the following:

* We aknowledge that there are many other underrepresented identities in technology, but we're being explicit but not exlusive about framing this conversation about the gender gap in technology.
* Assume best intent.
* No devil's advocate's. We want to have a meaningful conversation around the screening, not point out edge cases or "what if's".
* Let's practice our Active Listening skills.
* Keep the idea of "intent vs impact" in mind. We often judge ourselves by our intent and others by their impact (partly because we can't read their minds and know their true intent). If you say or do something that makes another person feel a certain way, you are responsible for the impact of your behavior regardless of what your intent was. 

The four groups we'd like you to choose from are the following:

  1) I want to be conscientious about gender issues. What can I do?   
  2) I’ve lived experiences like those referenced in the movie and want to share.  
  3) I disagree with the framing of the movie. Why are we even talking about this at a programming school?  
  4) I want to take action on this at Turing. What can I do?  

### Reflection Writing (10 minutes)

Write about your reaction the movie. Possible questions to keep in mind (if you can't think of anything to write about):

* What did you learn? 
* What did you already know? 
* What surprised you the most? 
* What do you agree/disagree with?

### Small Group Discussion (40 minutes)

Discuss the questions below for your group.

**I want to be conscientious about gender issues. What can I do?**
* Pick one discrete example from the movie that illustrates how the tech industry is not inclusive (ex: a woman leaving a company is shamed on social media). Name three situations in which you participate in the culture or policies that created that situation.
* Put yourself in the position of a woman affected by that situation. How might you want others to support you through the situation?
* What can you do to educate yourself about this situation without leaning on the woman affected to give you the solution?

**I’ve lived experiences like those referenced in the movie and want to share.**  
* What stories from the movie can you relate to? Why?
* Think back to a lived experience similar to those referenced in the movie. What would you have wanted or needed in that moment to feel better?
* Have you or anyone you’ve witnessed responded to sexism (subtle or not) in a way that was effective? If so, what was the response and why do you think it was effective?

**I disagree with the framing of the movie. Why are we even talking about this at a programming school?**  
* What have been your experiences expressing dissenting views here at Turing and in other settings?
* If you ran Turing, would you spend any time on community building? What types of activities would you prefer, if any? How would that change Turing as you know it?
* Turing’s mission includes a commitment to diversity and inclusion. What relationship do you have to that mission? Does the Turing community exist outside of that mission?

**I want to take action on this at Turing. What can I do?**
* Brainstorm a specific situation(s) you’ve either witnessed or heard of happening at Turing that might be similar to the stories shared in the movie. What could’ve someone witnessing the instance done differently to positively impact the outcome of situation?
* What do you personally need to feel comfortable responding to an action that doesn’t promote an inclusive environment?
* What specific resources (workshops, readings, discussions, etc.) could we offer at Turing to create awareness of exclusive behavior and to empower every individual to respond in an effective way? 

### Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

Each group shares key takeaways from small group discussion.
